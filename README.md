# Pytest cheat sheet

Pytest is a framework that makes building simple and scalable tests easy. Tests are expressive and readable-no boilerplate code required. Get started in minutes with a small unit test or complex functional test for your application or library.

## Install

	pip install pytest
	
## Example

In these exemple I will mostly use 3 file :
- `useless.py` which is the code you want to test
- `test_useless.py` which is the test file you will run
- `conftest.py` which contain directory-specific hook implementations


**Example:**
1. [Mark test as skip, pass, fail, etc..](example/mark.md)
2. [Add particular arguments]()
3. [Add particular arguments from file]()
