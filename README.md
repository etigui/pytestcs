# Pytest cheat sheet

Pytest is a framework that makes building simple and scalable tests easy. Tests are expressive and readable-no boilerplate code required. Get started in minutes with a small unit test or complex functional test for your application or library.

## Install

	pip install pytest
	
## Example

In these exemple we will mostly use 4 file :
- `useless.py` which is the code you want to test
- `test_useless.py` which is the test file you will run
- `conftest.py` which contain directory-specific hook implementations
- `test.txt` which contain multimple value to test


**Example:**
1. [Mark test function as skip, pass, fail, etc..](example/mark/mark.md)
2. [Add multimple value to test function](example/apa/apa.md)
3. [Add multimple value from file to test function](example/apaf/apaf.md)
4. [Pass arguments value to test function](example/pav/pav.md)
